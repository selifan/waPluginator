# Source code generator for modules, plugins and landing pages

## Installing
* Download current version of waPluginator and install it in current folder of your project or one of folders listed in "include_path"
* If you're planning to use scss source files and want them to be compiled to css, you have to download current version of scssphp PHP library from [github](http://leafo.github.io/scssphp) and install it into scssphp subfolder in one of folders listed in "include_path", so this code will work: `include_once("scssphp/scss.inc.php")`
* If you're planning to use less source files and want them to be compiled to css, you have to download current version of lessc.inc.php library from [github](http://leafo.github.io/scssphp) and copy it in one of folders listed in "include_path", so this code will work: `include_once("lessc.inc.php")`
